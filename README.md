# Website created using django for personal information display

### About
Project created in order to display personal portfolio and information about me.
This is intended to be hosted on GitHub pages, but since Pages aren't suporting django framework, website will be hosted on a different domain.
Since I have previously finished with Django learning course, I wanted to test my skills and create something that will be used.
